## :information_source: DISCLAIMER :

THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS ON LINUX MACHINES.

I have developped it on a linux system, it just displays weird errors once i have runned it on MACOS, so be aware.

---

## :wrench: This program checks :

:heavy_check_mark: check norm V3.0 [Install norminette](https://github.com/42Paris/norminette)

:heavy_check_mark: Check if files exist

:heavy_check_mark: Check prototype

:heavy_check_mark: Check bash scripts problems and c problems as well

### Your piscine folder should be structured like this :

```
|
|
|--Pool-Destroyer
|
|--piscine
|	|--shell00
|	|	|--ex00
|	|	|--ex01
|	|	|...
|	|	|
|	|--shell01
|	|	|--ex00
|	|	|--ex01
|	|	|...
|	|--c00
|	|--c01
|	|...
|
|
```

```
$>ls
piscine	pool_Destroyer	folder0	folder1 ...
```

```
> It means that the piscine folder should be placed in the same folder as "Pool-Destroyer" program.
```

---

## Launch tests :

### :information_source: Run the following command :

```
$>./grademe.sh

---

## Bugs :

> Shell00 and Shell01 still got a lot to fix on, so i advice you to relay only on C tests.
