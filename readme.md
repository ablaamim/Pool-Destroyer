## DISCLAIMER :

THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS ON LINUX MACHINES.

I have developped it on a linux system, it just displays weird errors once i have runned it on MACOS, so be aware.

---

## :wrench: This program checks :

:heavy_check_mark: check norm V3.0 [Install norminette](https://github.com/42Paris/norminette)

:heavy_check_mark: Check if files exist

:heavy_check_mark: Check prototype

:heavy_check_mark: Check bash scripts problems and c problems as well

### Your piscine folder should be structured like this :

```
|
|
|--Pool-Destroyer
|
|--piscine
|	|--shell00
|	|	|--ex00
|	|	|--ex01
|	|	|...
|	|	|
|	|--shell01
|	|	|--ex00
|	|	|--ex01
|	|	|...
|	|--c00
|	|--c01
|	|...
|
|
```

```
$>ls
piscine pool_Destroyer ...
```

```
> piscine folder should be placed in the same folder as "Pool-Destroyer" program.
```
